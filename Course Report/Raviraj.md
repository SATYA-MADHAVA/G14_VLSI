# Course Report

## Name: Raviraj

## Qualifications: M.tech

Welcome to the course report for the VLSI Designing - (Back-End)! This README document provides an overview of the course, its mini projects and final project.

### Assignment1

Q1: List out semiconductor products and its corresponding companaies
Ans:GPUs: NVIDIA, AMD
    Microprocessors: AMD, INTEL, Qualcomm
    ICs: STMicroelectronics, Analog devices, Texas Instruments
    Radio frequency ICs: Qualcomm, broadcomm
    Microcontroller: NXP, STMicroelectronics
    SoC: Mediatek,Qualcomm, Apple
    

Q2: What are the latest laptop processors from AMD, intel and apple: freq and node
Ans:INTEL: i9 12950HX 3.6-5GHz, 10nm
    AMD: Ryzen 9 5900HX 3.3-4.6GHz, 7nm
    Apple: M2
    

Q3: What are the latest mobile processors available from qualcomm and mediatek: freq and node
Ans: Qualcomm: snapdragon 8 Gen 3; 4nm 3.3GHz 
     Mediatek: Dimensity 9300 4nm, 3.25GHz
     Samsung:Exynos 1380 ; 5nm, 2.4GHz
     Apple: Apple silicon A17pro, 3nm TSMC, 3.78Ghz (2 ) and 2.11Ghz(4)

Q4: What are different job roles available in VLSI field?
Ans: Physical design, STA , Power delivery network (PDN), Synthesis engineer, RTL design engineer, Design verification, design for testability (DFT), Pre-Silicon validation, Post-Silicon Validation, Test engineer,

Q5: Comparison of BJT,MoSFET and FinFET
Ans:MoSFETs can be connected in parallel as compared to BJTs, that makes former more power effective. It is more stable to thermal changes than BJTs. Generally providing constant voltage than constant current is easy; as we already know MoSFET is VCVS(Voltage controlled voltage source) whereas BJT is CCVS (Current controlled voltage source). 
MoSFETs have the problem of short channel effects in deep submicron technology therefore FinFET is more preferred over former. Leakage current is less in FinFET as compare to MoSFET.FinFET has better gate controlability as compare to gate of MoSFET. 


Q6: Evolution of memory
Ans: Mainly memory is classified in Primary and secondary
     1. Primary Memory: a. RAM  b. ROM
			a1. SRAM a2. DRAM
				  a21. SDRAM a22. RDRAM a23. DDR SDRAM
								a231. DDR1 a232. DDR2 a233. DDR3 a234. DDR4
     2. Secondary Memory: HDD, SDD and USB
